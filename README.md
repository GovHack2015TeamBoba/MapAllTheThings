# MapAllTheThings

Mapping all the things to all the prizes - using the prizes on offer as a guide to what the people contributing the data want to see. It's not as mercenary as it sounds, really ;)
We feel that government data can be more accessible, especially geospatial data (or data that can be represented geospatially), which is currently hard to get to and understand. So we made a mapping tool that takes data sets and presents them as layers, allowing people to layer multiple data sets on top of each other to compare and contrast data.


## Spin Up

Run `npm install && npm start` which will start a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## GovHack Judges:
The actual entry code is in branch "GovHackEntry" - we haven't changed anything in that branch since the deadline
We're going to make some changes to the master branch (adding analytics, some more data sets, clean up some interfaces nasties, more wizard options, etc) that we'll then push to the [http://mapallthethings.com](http://mapallthethings.com) site.
We'll also create a backup copy of the site, probably at [http://mapallthethings.com/govhackentry](http://mapallthethings.com/govhackentry) based on the code as at the final bell of the competition

## Thanks for reading! :)
## And thanks for a truly excellent hackathon, we're very grateful for being able to attend it!
