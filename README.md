# MapAllTheThings

Mapping all the things to all the prizes


## Spin Up

Run `npm install && npm start` which will start a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## GovHack Judges:
The actual entry code is in branch "GovHackEntry" - we haven't changed anything in that branch since the deadline
We're going to make some changes to the master branch (adding analytics, some more data sets, clean up some interfaces nasties, more wizard options, etc) that we'll then push to the [http://mapallthethings.com](http://mapallthethings.com) site.
We'll also create a backup copy of the site, probably at [http://mapallthethings.com/govhackentry](http://mapallthethings.com/govhackentry) based on the code as at the final bell of the competition

## Thanks for reading! :)
## And thanks for a truly excellent hackathon, we're very grateful for being able to attend it!
